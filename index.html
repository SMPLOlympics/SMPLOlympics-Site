            Abstract
        </h2>
        <p>
        We present SMPLOlympics, a collection of physically simulated environments that allow humanoids to compete in a variety of Olympic sports. Sports simulation offers a rich and standardized testing ground for evaluating and improving the capabilities of learning algorithms due to the diversity and physically demanding nature of athletic activities. As humans have been competing in these sports for many years, there is also a plethora of existing knowledge on the preferred strategy to achieve better performance. To leverage human demonstrations from videos and motion capture, we design our humanoid to be compatible with the widely-used SMPL and SMPL-X human models from the vision and graphics community. We provide a suite of individual sports environments, including golf, javelin throw, high jump, long jump, and hurdling, as well as competitive sports, including both 1v1 or 2v2 games such as ping pong, tennis, fencing, boxing, soccer, and basketball. Our analysis based on these diverse tasks shows that combining strong motion priors with simple reward engineering can result in human-like behavior on various sports tasks. By providing a unified sports benchmark and baseline implementation of state and reward designs, we hope it can help both the control and animation communities achieve performant and human-like behaviors.
